# ESP-IDF Joystick Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Joystick Library in an ESP-IDF project with the LVGL library. The example creates a virtual joystick on the screen and captures the joystick's position through a callback function.

## Prerequisites

- **ESP-IDF**: Ensure that you have ESP-IDF installed and configured. Follow the official ESP-IDF setup guide: [ESP-IDF Setup Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html)
- **LVGL**: The LVGL library must be added as a component to your ESP-IDF project. [LVGL ESP Component](https://components.espressif.com/components/lvgl/lvgl)
